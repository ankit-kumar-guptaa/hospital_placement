            <p>India is grappling with a    critical shortage of radiologist doctors, especially in rural and underserved regions. The demand for advanced diagnostic imaging—such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans—has surged, yet the supply of trained professionals lags far behind. This imbalance stems from limited medical education slots, an uneven distribution of specialists, and a tendency for doctors to gravitate toward urban centers, leaving rural areas underserved.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Key Challenge:</strong> Over 70% of radiologists in India are concentrated in urban areas, leaving rural healthcare facilities struggling to meet patient needs.</p>
